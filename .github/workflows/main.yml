# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: subsystem-ubuntu

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      #Check hello world custom action
      - uses: itisdeep/custom-actions@master

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: build
        run: mvn clean install

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: check the build
        run: |
          ls -lart
          ls -lart ./target
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: subsystem-ubuntu
    steps:
    - name: deploy
      run: |
        ls -l ./target
        java -jar jb-hello-world-maven-0.1.0.jar
